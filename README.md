# Genetic PCA Visualization App

This Shiny app provides an interactive and geographic visualization of genetic population structure based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
It allows users to manually select specific regions and view zoomed PCA plots, both for standard scatterplots and for PCA plots warped to reflect real-world geography.

## Features

Interactive PCA Plot
  Select a region (e.g., Europe, Central Asia, East Asia) to focus on and view only populations from that area. 
  The PCA plot zooms in automatically for better resolution and comparison.

Warped Country Shapes on PCA
  The PCA coordinate space is overlaid with scaled country shapes, illustrating how genetic clusters correspond to actual geographic boundaries. 
  Region selection also zooms the warped map.

Real-World Maps 
  Includes annotated maps of Eurasia and of all countries included in the PCA dataset for geographic context.
